## Features ðŸš€

ðŸš€ Supports quickswap prices together and returns you the best price, so you do not need to query both yourself
<br/>
ðŸš€ Queries all the best routes and finds the best price for you
<br/>
ðŸš€ Exposes all the route paths it tried so you can see every detail in how it worked out the best price
<br/>
ðŸš€ Factor in the cost of the transaction into the quotes with 1 config change
<br/>
ðŸš€ Easy subscriptions to get alerted when the price moves or the trade expires
<br/>
ðŸš€ The transaction is generated for you, just fill it with the gas details and send it on its way
<br/>
ðŸš€ All the figures are all formatted for you, no need to worry about timing it back to its decimal formatted place, just render it straight onto your UI
<br/>
ðŸš€ Exposes all the tokens metadata for you, name, symbol, decimals
<br/>
ðŸš€ Uses [multicall](https://github.com/joshstevens19/ethereum-multicall) for every on chain lookup, so even though it could be doing 100 JSONRPC calls it is all put into a few calls meaning it can stay very fast
<br/>
ðŸš€ Tidy bundle size
<br/>
ðŸš€ Fully typescript supported with full generated typings
<br/>
ðŸš€ query many tokens in 1 jsonrpc call perfect to get token metadata fast
<br/>

```
import { UniswapPair, ChainId as UniswapChainId, UniswapPairSettings, UniswapVersion, TradeDirection} from 'simple-quickswap-sdk';


const uniswapPair = new UniswapPair({
    // the contract address of the token you want to convert FROM
    fromTokenContractAddress: token1Address,
    // the contract address of the token you want to convert TO
    toTokenContractAddress: token2Address,
    // the ethereum address of the user using this part of the dApp
    ethereumAddress: '0x207ca4370639120f9A049aF9CAB4fCaa608F2445',
    // you can pass in the provider url as well if you want
    providerUrl: Provider.PolygonMainnet,
    chainId: QuickChainId.MATIC,
    settings: new UniswapPairSettings({
      uniswapVersions: [UniswapVersion.v2],      
    })
  });
  const UniswapPairFactory = await uniswapPair.createFactory();
  const tradeRoutes = await UniswapPairFactory.findAllPossibleRoutesWithQuote('1',TradeDirection.input)
